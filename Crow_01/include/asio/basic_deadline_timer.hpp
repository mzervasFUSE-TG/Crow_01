/// Provides waitable timer functionality.
/**
 * The basic_deadline_timer class template provides the ability to perform a
 * blocking or asynchronous wait for a timer to expire.
 *
 * A deadline timer is always in one of two states: "expired" or "not expired".
 * If the wait() or async_wait() function is called on an expired timer, the
 * wait operation will complete immediately.
 *
 * Most applications will use the asio::deadline_timer typedef.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
 * @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe.
 *
 * @par Examples
 * Performing a blocking wait:
 * @code
 * // Construct a timer without setting an expiry time.
 * asio::deadline_timer timer(my_context);
 *
 * // Set an expiry time relative to now.
 * timer.expires_from_now(boost::posix_time::seconds(5));
 *
 * // Wait for the timer to expire.
 * timer.wait();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par 
 * Performing an asynchronous wait:
 * @code
 * void handler(const asio::error_code& error)
 * {
 *   if (!error)
 *   {
 *     // Timer expired.
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Construct a timer with an absolute expiry time.
 * asio::deadline_timer timer(my_context,
 *     boost::posix_time::time_from_string("2005-12-07 23:59:59.000"));
 *
 * // Start an asynchronous wait.
 * timer.async_wait(handler);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Changing an active deadline_timer's expiry time
 *
 * Changing the expiry time of a timer while there are pending asynchronous
 * waits causes those wait operations to be cancelled. To ensure that the action
 * associated with the timer is performed only once, use something like this:
 * used:
 *
 * @code
 * void on_some_event()
 * {
 *   if (my_timer.expires_from_now(seconds(5)) > 0)
 *   {
 *     // We managed to cancel the timer. Start new asynchronous wait.
 *     my_timer.async_wait(on_timeout);
 *   }
 *   else
 *   {
 *     // Too late, timer has already expired!
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * void on_timeout(const asio::error_code& e)
 * {
 *   if (e != asio::error::operation_aborted)
 *   {
 *     // Timer was not cancelled, take necessary action.
 *   }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @li The asio::basic_deadline_timer::expires_from_now() function
 * cancels any pending asynchronous waits, and returns the number of
 * asynchronous waits that were cancelled. If it returns 0 then you were too
 * late and the wait handler has already been executed, or will soon be
 * executed. If it returns 1 then the wait handler was successfully cancelled.
 *
 * @li If a wait handler is cancelled, the asio::error_code passed to
 * it contains the value asio::error::operation_aborted.
